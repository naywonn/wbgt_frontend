      <p>A WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature) device is a sophisticated measurement 
          tool that utilizes various environmental factors such as ambient temperature, 
          relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation to calculate a comprehensive index. 
          This index, known as the WBGT value, provides valuable insights into the environmental 
          conditions during physical activities and exercise. It enables users to monitor and 
          assess potential heat stress and its impact on the human body, ensuring safety and 
          optimal performance during workouts or outdoor activities.</p>
